# Introduction

### Lab preconfiguration and agent setup

Since the digital channels labs are in a shared tenant, the first 3 configuration steps have been done for you to save time and potentially duplicated efforts in the labs. Please note that these steps must be undertaken if you want to turn up digital channels in a true production environment, so we will note them here for your future reference.

Please look over steps 1, 2 & 3; then proceed to the subsequent steps which will require admin configuration.

Once you complete this preconfiguration lab, you are free to move on to either Lab 2 (email), 3 (chat), 5 (SMS) or 6 (WhatsApp) depending on your preference.

### Configuration Order

<br/>
<br/>

## Step 1. Node Authorization for Webex CC Task and Engage nodes - *This step has been preconfigured for you*

Webex Connect: **[https://labtenant.us.webexconnect.io/](https://labtenant.us.webexconnect.io/){:target="\_blank"}**\

Webex Connect is required to provide a valid access token for using various Webex Contact Center and Webex Engage APIs. The access token is generated using the authorization details configured within the ‘Node Runtime Authorization’ field that Webex Contact Center users are required to provide during flow configuration.

- To authorize a pre-built integration login into Webex connect and go to **Assets** -> **Integrations**. The integrations which are not yet authorized show the status as **Authorization Pending**.

- In front of **Webex CC Engage** Click **Actions** -> **Manage**.

<img align="middle" src="/digital/assets/images/Lab1_Integration1.gif" width="1000" />
<br/>
<br/>

- On the Manage Integrations page, scroll down to the **Node Authorizations** section. This section lists all the authorizations mapped to this integration.

- Click **Action** → **Add Authorization** associated with the **WxCC Engage Authorization**, where Auth Type is oauth2 and Status is Authorization Pending.

<img align="middle" src="/digital/assets/images/Lab1_ManageIntegration1.png" width="1000" />
<br/>
<br/>

- Enter the Authorization Name and click **Authorize**. In that example we use **WxCC Engage Authorization**.

<img align="middle" src="/digital/assets/new_images/LAB1_preconfig/LAB1_1_engage_auth_png" width="1000" />
<br/>
<br/>

- Click on the back button for being redirected back to **Integrations** page and in front of **Webex CC Task** Click **Actions** → **Manage**.

<img align="middle" src="/digital/assets/images/Lab1_ManageIntegration2.gif" width="1000" />
<br/>
<br/>

- On the Manage Integrations page, scroll down to the **Node Authorizations** section. This section lists all the authorizations mapped to this integration. Click **Action** → **Add Authorization** associated with the **WxCC Authorization**, where Auth Type is oauth2 and Status is Authorization Pending.

<img align="middle" src="/digital/assets/images/Lab1_ManageIntegration3.png" width="1000" />
<br/>
<br/>

- Enter the **Authorization Name** (for example: **WxCC Authorization**) and click **Authorize**. As the result the pop-up appears where you need to enter your Cisco admin email address and click **Sign in**.

<img align="middle" src="/digital/assets/new_images\LAB1_preconfig\LAB1_2_task_auth_png" width="1000" />
<br/>
<br/>

- Click back button for being redirected back to **Integrations** page. Verify that the status of the authorizations is changed to **Authorized**.

  <br/>
  <br/>


## Step 2. Setup RONA timers - *This step has been preconfigured for you*

If an agent doesn’t answer a contact request, the contact request will return to the queue and the agent state will change to **Redirection on No Answer (RONA)**. In this task, you will play with the feature that allows administrators to override the default RONA timeout values at the tenant level for every channel type to suit the business needs of the organization. The available channels are:

- Telephony
- Chat
- Email
- Social (Facebook and WhatsApp)

- Log in to the Control Hub at [https://admin.webex.com](https://admin.webex.com){:target="\_blank"}

- Navigate to **Services** -> **Contact Center** -> **Settings** -> **Desktop** -> **RONA Timeouts**.
  <img align="middle" src="/digital/assets/new_images\LAB1_preconfig\lab1_8_RONA_timers_png" width="1000" />
  <br/>
  <br/>

- Modify the existing timers by using the values from the tables below:

| **Channel** | **New Values** | **Limitations**  |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Telephony   | 18             | 1 - 120 seconds  |
| Chat        | 60             | 1 - 6000 seconds |
| Email       | 90             | 1 - 6000 seconds |
| Social      | 60             | 1 - 6000 seconds |

## Step 3. Create a new Multimedia profile and a new site 

- Login to Managment Portal by accessing [https://portal.wxcc-us1.cisco.com/portal](https://portal.wxcc-us1.cisco.com/portal){:target="\_blank"}

- Enter the admin email address and click **_Sign in_**

- Click on **_Provisioning_** and select **_Multimedia Profiles_**

- Click on + New Multimedia Profile to open Multimedia Profile configuration page.

- Input Name as `MMP_0XX`.

- In the Media Details section, select the blended multimedia profile and input `1` for Voice, `3` for Chat, `3` for Email, , `3` for Social Channel and click on Save button.

<br/>
<br/>

## Step 4. Create a new service for your Digital channel flows

Navigate to Webex Connect: [https://labtenant.us.webexconnect.io](https://labtenant.us.webexconnect.io){:target="\_blank"}

- Click **_Create New Service_** button and add a service named `My First Service 0XX` where 0XX is your 3 digit Lab ID. In all subsequent labs, assets will be associated to this service

<br/>
<br/>

## Step 5. Setup agents in Portal (Agents, Team)

 Portal: **[https://portal.wxcc-us1.cisco.com/portal](https://portal.wxcc-us1.cisco.com/portal){:target="\_blank"}**\

This step shows how to access the admin portal and navigate the different configuration menus to create a Site, Team, and Multimedia Profile that will be assigned to the Contact Center user. The agent has been created for you

### Users

The users have the following preconfiguration

| **User Role** | **User email**                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Agent         | wxcclabs+agent\_ ID<0XX>@gmail.com |

> **Note:** Your admin account password was given to you personally. <0XX> is your 3 digit lab number. For Example: ```wxcclabs+agent_ID070@gmail.com```

### User Settings

We will be associating the below configurations you created with the agent

| **Entity**          | **Name**  |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| Multimedia Profiles | MMP_0XX       |
| Site                | Site_0XX      |
| Team1               | Team1_0XX |
| Team2               | Team2_0XX |

### Step 5.1. Create new Teams

- Navigate to **_Provisioning_** and select Team.

- Click on + New Team.

- Select **_Site_** from the Site drop-down.

- Input Name as `Team1_0XX` where `0XX` is the 3-digit LAB ID

- Use the default Type `Agent Based`.

- Select `MMP_0XX` in the **_Multimedia Profile_** drop-down where `0XX` is your 3-digit LAB ID

- Leave `Global Layout` in the Desktop Layout drop-down as the default value and hit Save.

Please follow the same steps as above to add an extra Team as `Team2_0XX`

### Step 5.2. User Configuration

- Click on **_Provisioning_** and select **_Users_**.

- Click on `...` for the **Agent** user, to launch the **_Edit_** view for the agent that is designated for your lab: wxcclabs+agent\_ ID<0XX>@gmail.com.

- Make sure that the **_User Profile_** is set as **_Premium Agent User Profile_**.

- Click on **_Contact Center Enabled_** toggle to move it to **_On_**.

- In the **_Agent Settings_** section, select `Site_0XX` in the **_Site_** drop-down.

- Click the **_Teams_** area and select `Team1_0XX` and `Team2_0XX`.

- Select `Agent Profile` in the **_Desktop Profile_** drop-down list. 

- Select `MMP_0XX` in the **_Multimedia Profile_** drop-down and hit **_Save_**.

## Step 6. Verification: Access to the Agent Desktop

**Note**: To log in to the agent desktop, **use either a separate web browser or a new incognito web page**. This will prevent any browser caching issues with admin and agent credentials.

- Navigate to **[https://desktop.wxcc-us1.cisco.com/](https://desktop.wxcc-us1.cisco.com/){:target="\_blank"}** in a new browser or in incognito mode.

- Enter the agent’s **email ID** `wxcclabs+agent_ID<0XX>@gmail.com`.

- Enter the **Password** for the appropriate Username.

- In the **_Station Login_** pane, select **"Extension"** and enter any number, for instance 1000.

> **Note:** The Webex Calling service is not activated at this tenant we need to set a dummy extension only once during the login.

- Select the `Team1_0XX` and click **_Submit_**. Make sure that you are successfully logged in to the Agent Desktop. Now you can continue with the Next Lab.
